# E-Commerce Back End
I will build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying the starter code. I will configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.
## Installation
Run ```npm i``` in your terminal to install all of this repo's dependencies. The dependencies are:
* ```mysql2```
* ```sequelize```
* ```dotenv```
* ```express```
* ## Usage
* This can be used in an online business when they are updating the products and categories.
